# dewy

Dewy is a website for searching through your bookmarked Stack Overflow posts. 

I regularly bookmark useful posts that I can reference later. However, finding a post I'd saved seemed a bit cumbersome. This project was created to provide simple search functionality that would make finding bookmarked posts quicker and easier.

Dewy is built on the [Hugo-ing](https://github.com/Sammy-T/hugo-ing) template and is configured to run on Netlify.
