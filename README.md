# dewy

Dewy is a website for searching through your bookmarked Stack Overflow posts. 

I find that I regularly bookmark useful posts that I can reference later. However, I thought it was odd that there was no way to find a post I'd saved aside from manually navigating through each bookmark page. This project was created to provide simple search functionality that would make finding bookmarked posts quicker and easier.

Dewy is built on the [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo) template ([README](VICTOR_HUGO_README.md)) and is configured to be tested and deployed using Netlify.
