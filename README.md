# dewy

Dewy is a website for searching through your bookmarked Stack Overflow posts. 

I regularly bookmark useful posts that I can reference later. However, finding a post I'd saved seemed a bit cumbersome. This project was created to provide simple search functionality that would make finding bookmarked posts quicker and easier.

Dewy is built on the [Hugo-ing](https://github.com/Sammy-T/hugo-ing) template and is configured to run on Netlify.

**This project is no longer maintained. Stack Overflow has moved their bookmarks to a 'saves' section causing the 'favorites' API endpoint to no longer function and the API documentation to be out-of-date.**
