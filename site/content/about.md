#### Pre-installed
Hugo-ing includes [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) CSS and [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) as dependencies. Remove/Replace them with whatever best suits your website.

#### Processing files
Import files you want Hugo to process within their respective directories in `site/assets`.

Hugo Pipes also offers processing of SASS/SCSS files and transpilation with Babel among other features.  
For more information on additional processing options visit <https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/>.

#### Non-processed files
Place files you don't want processed within the `site/static` directory.
